# LXWorkshop


This project contains materials for learning how to use LXSeries software.  There are files from LXSeries workshops that teach the basics of the software.  There are also files designed to be used to explore lighting concepts using the LXSeries applications.

The Light Lab folder provides pre-built files that students can use to explore creating lighting looks.  The workshop folders contain Keynotes and example files from LXSeries Workshop presentations that are arranged as a follow-along tutorial.

----------------------------------------------------------

This is a summary of the contents of each of the folders:

### LightLab
The files in this folder can be used as a starting point for creating renderings of lighting with **LXBeams** and **LXFree for Java**.

### LXWorkshop PDFs
