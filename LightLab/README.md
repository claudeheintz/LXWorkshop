# Light Lab

The files in this folder can be used as a starting point for creating renderings of lighting with **LXBeams** and **LXFree for Java**.

The **LightLab.lxxplot** file is a simple light plot with various front/side/back lighting options.  It includes Cyc lighting and some templates.

The **zip_files** folder contains archives combining the **LightLab.lxxplot** file and basic instructions for both MacOS and Windows.

The **console_files** folder contains files for **LXConsole** and **ETC EOS Nomad** that are patched to work with the light lab plot.
